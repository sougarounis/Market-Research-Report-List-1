<p><strong>The Thoracic Catheters Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumothorax</li><li>Pleural Effusion</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thoracic catheters are commonly used in medical settings to treat conditions such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and other related conditions. Pneumothorax is a condition where air accumulates in the space between the lungs and chest wall, causing lung collapse. Pleural effusion refers to the accumulation of excess fluid between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity. Thoracic catheters are inserted into these spaces to drain air or fluid, allowing the lungs to expand and function properly. They are also used in other similar conditions that require drainage of abnormal accumulations to restore normal lung function.</p></p>
