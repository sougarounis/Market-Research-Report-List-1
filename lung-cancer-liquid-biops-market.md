<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lung Cancer Liquid Biops Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exosomes and RNA</li><li>CTCs and ctDNA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The liquid biopsy market for lung cancer encompasses two main types: exosomes and RNA, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Exosomes are small lipid vesicles released by cells, carrying genetic material that can be analyzed to identify lung cancer-related mutations. RNA analysis involves studying specific gene expression patterns to detect cancer-related changes. CTCs are cancer cells shed by tumors into the bloodstream, whereas ctDNA refers to tumor-specific DNA fragments present in the blood. Both CTCs and ctDNA can be used to identify genetic alterations associated with lung cancer.</p></p>
