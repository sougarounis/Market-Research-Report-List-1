<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Patient Temperature Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Temperature Monitoring</li><li>Invasive Temperature Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Patient Temperature Monitoring System market includes two main types of temperature monitoring methods: non-invasive and invasive. Non-invasive temperature monitoring involves measuring the patient's temperature without penetrating the body, typically done using devices like infrared thermometers or tympanic thermometers. Invasive temperature monitoring, on the other hand, involves inserting a temperature probe into the patient's body, often through the rectum or esophagus, to directly measure internal body temperature. Both methods have their advantages and are used in different clinical situations depending on the patient's condition and requirements.</p></p>
