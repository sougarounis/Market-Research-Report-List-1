<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermostatic Steam Trap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bi-metal Strip Type</li><li>Balanced Pressure Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The thermostatic steam trap market consists of two main types: the bi-metal strip type and the balanced pressure type. Bi-metal strip steam traps use a bi-metal strip that expands and contracts with temperature changes to control the discharge of condensate. These traps are typically used in low-pressure systems. On the other hand, the balanced pressure steam traps have a diaphragm mechanism which maintains a balance between the steam and condensate pressures, allowing the release of condensate. They are commonly utilized in high-pressure systems. Both types play a crucial role in regulating the flow of condensate in steam systems.</p></p>
