<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Friction Damper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable Shock Absorber</li><li>Non-Adjustable Shock Absorber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The friction damper market consists of two main types: adjustable shock absorbers and non-adjustable shock absorbers. Adjustable shock absorbers offer the ability to modify the damping characteristics according to specific requirements, providing enhanced control and flexibility. On the other hand, non-adjustable shock absorbers have a fixed damping setting and cannot be modified. Both types contribute to damping vibration and providing stability, but adjustable shock absorbers cater to more varied needs and applications compared to non-adjustable ones.</p></p>
