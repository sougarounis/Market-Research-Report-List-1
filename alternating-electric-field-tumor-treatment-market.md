<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alternating Electric Field Tumor Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Frequency</li><li>Intermediate Frequency</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alternating Electric Field (AEF) Tumor Treatment market is divided into Low Frequency and Intermediate Frequency types. Low Frequency AEF treatment employs electrical currents with frequencies below 100 kHz to target tumor cells. This treatment harnesses the principle of impedance mismatch between tumor and normal cells, inhibiting tumor growth. On the other hand, Intermediate Frequency AEF treatment employs electrical currents with frequencies between 100 kHz and 1 MHz to disrupt cancer cell division and induce cell death. Both types of AEF treatment offer potential therapeutic options for various cancer types.</p></p>
