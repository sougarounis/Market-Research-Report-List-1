<p><h1>Drug Coated Stent Market Size 2024 - 2031 Global Industrial Analysis, Key Geographical Regions, Market Share, Top Key Players, Product Types and Forecast Research Report</h1></p><p><strong>Drug Coated Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A drug coated stent is a medical device used to treat blocked or narrowed arteries in the heart. It is a metal mesh tube that is placed in the artery to keep it open and improve blood flow. The stent is coated with a special medication that is slowly released to prevent the artery from becoming blocked again.</p><p>The drug coated stent market has witnessed significant growth in recent years and is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 7.4% during the forecast period. Increasing cases of cardiovascular diseases, growing geriatric population, and advancements in stent technologies are some of the key factors driving the growth of the market.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the drug coated stent market is the development of bioabsorbable stents. These stents are designed to gradually dissolve and be absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for a permanent implant. Bioabsorbable stents have gained popularity as they reduce the risk of long-term complications associated with traditional metal stents.</p><p>Another trend in the market is the introduction of drug eluting stents with biodegradable polymers. These stents release the medication to prevent reblockage of the artery, but the polymer itself is designed to degrade over time. This reduces the risk of inflammation and other adverse effects associated with permanent polymers used in traditional drug coated stents.</p><p>In conclusion, the drug coated stent market is expected to experience steady growth in the coming years. The development of bioabsorbable stents and drug eluting stents with biodegradable polymers are some of the latest trends driving the market. These advancements in stent technologies are expected to improve patient outcomes and further propel the growth of the market.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Drug Coated Stent Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Angioplasty</li><li>Restenosis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The drug-coated stent market finds its application primarily in the field of angioplasty, a widely performed medical procedure that helps open blocked or narrowed blood vessels. A drug-coated stent is a tiny mesh tube coated with medication that is inserted into a narrowed artery during angioplasty. It is used to prevent restenosis, which is the re-narrowing of the blood vessel after the procedure. By releasing medication directly into the artery, the stents lower the risk of restenosis and improve the long-term outcomes of angioplasty.</p></p>
