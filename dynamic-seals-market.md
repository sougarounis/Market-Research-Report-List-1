<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dynamic Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Seal</li><li>Non-contact Seal</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dynamic seals are used to prevent leakage and friction in various mechanical systems. Contact seals, also known as radial lip seals or oil seals, create a physical barrier between moving and stationary parts. They rely on constant contact with the mating surfaces to provide effective sealing. Non-contact seals, such as labyrinth seals or magnetic seals, use alternative methods to prevent leakage without physical contact. They employ features like interlocking teeth or magnetic forces to create a barrier and maintain a gap between the sealing surfaces. Both contact and non-contact seals have specific applications depending on the requirements of the system.</p></p>
