<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Air Valves</li><li>Double Air Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air valve market consists of two main types: single air valves and double air valves. Single air valves are designed to release air trapped in a pipeline, preventing airlocks and ensuring smooth flow. They allow air to escape when the pressure in the pipeline exceeds atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, double air valves serve a similar purpose but are equipped with two different chambers, providing enhanced functionality and control over the air release and intake processes. Both types are crucial in maintaining efficient and uninterrupted fluid flow systems.</p></p>
