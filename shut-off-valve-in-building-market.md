<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shut-off Valve in Building Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ball Value</li><li>Butterfly Valve</li><li>Gate Valve</li><li>Globe Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shut-off valves are essential components used in building infrastructure to control the flow of fluids or gases. The market for shut-off valves can be divided into four types: ball valves, butterfly valves, gate valves, and globe valves. Ball valves have a spherical disc that controls the flow by rotating it. Butterfly valves use a disc that rotates at a right angle to the flow. Gate valves have a sliding gate to control the flow. Globe valves have a plug that moves up and down to control the flow. These valves vary in design and application but all serve the purpose of shutting off or regulating fluid flow.</p></p>
