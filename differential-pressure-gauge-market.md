<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential Pressure Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piston</li><li>Diaphragm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Differential pressure gauges are used to measure the difference in pressure between two points in a system. There are two main types: piston and diaphragm. Piston gauges use a piston mechanism to measure the pressure difference, while diaphragm gauges use a flexible diaphragm. Both types have their advantages and are used in different applications. Piston gauges provide high accuracy and are commonly used in laboratory settings. Diaphragm gauges are more cost-effective and are commonly used in industrial applications where precise measurements are not required.</p></p>
