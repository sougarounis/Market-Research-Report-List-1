<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DDoS Mitigation Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud Based</li><li>Web Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DDoS Mitigation Services are classified into two types: Cloud Based and Web Based. Cloud Based DDoS Mitigation Services use a network of servers and infrastructure to filter and mitigate malicious traffic before it reaches the target website. This type offers scalability, high availability, and global coverage, making it suitable for large organizations. On the other hand, Web Based DDoS Mitigation Services deploy hardware appliances or software on the organization's own infrastructure. This offers more control and customization options, but may lack the scalability and global coverage provided by cloud-based solutions.</p></p>
