<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Voltage Indicators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non Contact</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Voltage indicators are devices used to detect and display the presence of live voltage in electrical systems. There are two main types of voltage indicators: contact and non-contact. </p><p>Contact voltage indicators require physical contact with the electrical conductors to measure the voltage. They employ probes or test leads that are touched to the conductors and display the voltage reading on a screen or through an LED indicator.</p><p>Non-contact voltage indicators, on the other hand, do not require direct contact with the conductors. They use electromagnetic fields to detect the presence of voltage without needing physical contact. These indicators typically have a sensor that is held close to the electrical equipment and provide visual or audible alerts when voltage is detected.</p><p>Both contact and non-contact voltage indicators serve the purpose of ensuring electrical safety by alerting users to the presence of live voltage. Their specific use depends on the requirements and preferences of the user.</p></p>
