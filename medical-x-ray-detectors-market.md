<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical X-ray detectors are devices used to capture and convert X-ray radiation into an electrical signal for image formation. There are two types of detectors: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors use a scintillator material to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then converted into an electrical signal. Direct conversion detectors, on the other hand, directly convert X-rays into an electrical signal using materials like selenium or cadmium zinc telluride. Both types have their advantages and drawbacks, depending on factors such as image quality, cost, and efficiency.</p></p>
