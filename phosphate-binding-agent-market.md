<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phosphate Binding Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Calcium-based Phosphorus Binders</li><li>Aluminum-based Phosphorus Binders</li><li>Magnesium-based Phosphorus Binders</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phosphate binding agents are medications commonly used in patients with kidney disease to regulate high levels of phosphate in the blood. Calcium-based phosphorus binders work by binding to phosphate in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption. Aluminum-based phosphorus binders were previously used but are rarely used nowadays due to potential toxic side effects. Magnesium-based phosphorus binders have a similar mechanism of action to calcium-based binders and are also used to lower phosphate levels. "Others" generally refers to newer, less common types of phosphate binding agents that may have different mechanisms of action.</p></p>
