<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NTC Inrush Current Limiters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Type</li><li>Diode Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>NTC Inrush Current Limiters are devices used to limit the excessive current flow during the initial power-up or when switching on an electrical circuit. There are two types of NTC Inrush Current Limiters available in the market - Radial Type and Diode Type. Radial Type limiters consist of NTC thermistors connected in series with resistors, providing a higher inrush current-limiting effect. On the other hand, Diode Type limiters employ a diode in parallel with the NTC thermistor, creating a shorter time constant for limiting the current. Both types serve the purpose of preventing damage and improving the reliability of electrical circuits by controlling inrush currents.</p></p>
