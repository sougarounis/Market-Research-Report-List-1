<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Solar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied Solar System</li><li>Off Grid Solar System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The residential solar market consists of two main types: grid-tied solar systems and off-grid solar systems. A grid-tied solar system is connected to the local electrical grid, allowing homeowners to produce their own electricity while still being able to draw power from the grid if needed. This type of system often allows homeowners to sell excess power back to the grid. On the other hand, an off-grid solar system operates independently of the grid, typically using batteries to store excess power for use when the sun is not shining. This type of system is commonly used in remote areas without access to the electrical grid.</p></p>
