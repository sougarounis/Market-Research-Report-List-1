<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuro-Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Neuro-stimulators</li><li>Non-invasive Neuro-stimulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neuro-stimulators are medical devices used to stimulate nerves in the body for therapeutic purposes. There are two main types: invasive and non-invasive neuro-stimulators. Invasive neuro-stimulators require a surgical procedure for implantation inside the body, directly stimulating specific nerves. Non-invasive neuro-stimulators, on the other hand, do not require any invasive procedure and use external devices to stimulate nerves, usually through electrical pulses or magnetic fields. Both types are used in various medical applications to treat conditions like chronic pain, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and depression.</p></p>
