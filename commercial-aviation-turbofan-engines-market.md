<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Aviation Turbofan Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Bypass Turbofan Engines</li><li>Low-Bypass Turbofan Engines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial aviation turbofan engines can be categorized into two types: high-bypass turbofan engines and low-bypass turbofan engines. High-bypass turbofan engines have a larger fan at the front, which allows a significant amount of air to bypass the core engine, providing high thrust and fuel efficiency. These engines are commonly used in large commercial aircraft. On the other hand, low-bypass turbofan engines have a smaller fan, resulting in less bypass air but higher core engine performance. These engines are typically used in smaller commercial aircraft.</p></p>
