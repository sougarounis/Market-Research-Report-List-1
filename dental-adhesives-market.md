<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching Adhesive</li><li>Selective-etching Adhesive</li><li>Total-etching Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental adhesives are used to bond restorative materials, such as dental composites, to the natural tooth structure. There are three types of dental adhesives based on their etching technique: self-etching adhesive, selective-etching adhesive, and total-etching adhesive. Self-etching adhesives eliminate the need for separate etching, as they simultaneously self-etch and prime the tooth surface. Selective-etching adhesives partially etch the enamel, leaving the dentin unetched. Total-etching adhesives thoroughly etch both enamel and dentin. These different types cater to the specific needs of dental procedures, offering varying levels of bonding strength and technique convenience.</p></p>
