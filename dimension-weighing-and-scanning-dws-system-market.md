<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dimension Weighing and Scanning (DWS) System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static System</li><li>Dynamic System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Dimension Weighing and Scanning (DWS) System market consists of two main types: Static Systems and Dynamic Systems. Static Systems are stationary and require the object to be placed on a platform for measurement. These systems are commonly used in warehouses and logistics centers. On the other hand, Dynamic Systems are capable of measuring the weight and dimensions of moving objects, such as conveyor belts. These systems are more suitable for high-volume distribution centers and shipping hubs. Both types of systems help optimize shipping processes and improve accuracy in size and weight measurements.</p></p>
