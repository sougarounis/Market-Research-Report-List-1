<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inkjet Marking Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CIJ</li><li>DOD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inkjet Marking Equipment refers to printers that use inkjet technology for various marking applications. Continuous Inkjet (CIJ) is a type of inkjet printing wherein a continuous stream of ink droplets is emitted from a nozzle, and electronically charged deflection plates guide them onto the substrate. Drop on Demand (DOD) inkjet printing is another type where ink droplets are expelled from the nozzle when required, enabling precise marking by controlling the ink droplet formation. Both CIJ and DOD have their specific uses and advantages in the inkjet marking equipment market.</p></p>
