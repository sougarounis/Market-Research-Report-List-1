<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Single Phase Gas Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Residential single phase gas smart meters come in two types: IC card and non-IC card markets. IC card meters require the user to top up their gas credit using a physical card, similar to prepaid mobile service. On the other hand, non-IC card meters do not require the use of a physical card for credit top-up. Instead, users pay for their gas usage through other means, such as online payments or bank transfers. Both types provide convenient and effective ways for residential customers to monitor and manage their gas consumption.</p></p>
