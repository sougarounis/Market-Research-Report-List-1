<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PH Probes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Refillable</li><li>Refillable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PH probes are used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a substance. Non-refillable probes are pre-filled with a gel electrolyte that cannot be replenished once it dries out, requiring the probe to be replaced. Refillable probes, on the other hand, can have their electrolyte solution refreshed, prolonging their lifespan and making them more cost-effective in the long run. Both probe types serve the same purpose but differ in terms of sustainability and maintenance requirements.</p></p>
